# wa-tui

Terminal UI for WhatsApp Web, built with [neo-blessed](https://www.npmjs.com/package/neo-blessed) and [whatsapp-web.js](https://wwebjs.dev/). Scan a QR code in the terminal, then browse chats, read messages, reply, and download media without leaving your shell.

## Requirements

- **Node.js** 18 or newer  
- **Google Chrome** or **Chromium** installed locally — `whatsapp-web.js` drives a headless browser session; if startup fails, install Chrome or point Puppeteer at your binary (see [whatsapp-web.js docs](https://docs.wwebjs.dev/)).

Session data and cache are stored under `.wwebjs_auth` and `.wwebjs_cache` in the current working directory (and settings under `~/.wa-tui/`).

## Install

### Homebrew (macOS / Linux)

Uses [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) so `wa-tui` is on your PATH like any other CLI. This repository contains [`Formula/wa-tui.rb`](Formula/wa-tui.rb), which installs the published npm tarball and pulls in **Node** as a dependency. Because the GitHub repository is named `wa-tui` rather than `homebrew-wa-tui`, tap it with an explicit URL:

```bash
brew tap gtchakama/wa-tui https://github.com/gtchakama/wa-tui
brew install gtchakama/wa-tui/wa-tui
```

Upgrade later with `brew upgrade wa-tui`. You still need **Chrome** or **Chromium** locally (see Requirements).

### npm

```bash
npm install -g @gtchakama/wa-tui
```

Or run without a global install:

```bash
npx @gtchakama/wa-tui
```

From a git checkout:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Usage

```bash
wa-tui
```

Run the command from whatever directory you want to use for WhatsApp session files (`.wwebjs_auth`, `.wwebjs_cache` are created in the **current working directory**). Per-user settings live under `~/.wa-tui/`.

### First run (QR)

1. Start `wa-tui` and wait for the QR block to appear in the terminal.
2. On your phone open **WhatsApp → Settings → Linked devices → Link a device** and scan the code.
3. After login, the **chat list** loads. The **footer** at the bottom shows shortcuts for the screen you’re on.

### Chat list

- **Move** through chats with **↑↓** (or **j / k**).
- **Enter** opens the highlighted chat.
- **Mouse**: you can click a row if your terminal supports it.
- **1** All chats · **2** Direct messages only · **3** Groups only.
- **U** Toggle **unread-only** list.
- **O** Cycle sort: **recent** → **unread first** → **A–Z**.
- **N** / **P** Next / previous **page** of chats (see header `P1`, `P2`, …).
- **R** Reload the chat list.
- **F2** Open **colour settings** (palette applies after **Enter**; **Esc** / **F2** closes).
- **Ctrl+L** **Log out** (ends the session and exits).
- **Q** or **Ctrl+C** **Quit** without logging out (session may remain linked).

### Inside a conversation

- Focus is on the **message box** at the bottom. Type text and press **Enter** to **send**.
- **Esc** If you’re quoting a message, clears the quote; if not, **returns to the chat list** (draft for that chat is kept).
- **B** **Back** to the chat list (same as Esc when not quoting).
- **Ctrl+↑** / **Ctrl+↓** Move the **quote/reply** target to a **newer or older** message (▶ marks the selected line). Then send as usual to reply quoting that message.
- **Ctrl+D** **Download** media from the quoted message if it has an attachment; otherwise tries the latest message with media. Saved under **`~/Downloads/wa-tui/`** (path is echoed in the log).
- Scroll the transcript with the mouse wheel or your terminal’s scroll keys if supported (**PgUp** / **PgDn** often work on focused log widgets).

### Colour settings (F2)

- Choose a palette and press **Enter** to apply. Settings are written to **`~/.wa-tui/settings.json`**.
- **Esc** or **F2** closes settings. **Q** still quits the app.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `WA_TUI_RESIZE` | Set to `1` to enable resize-related behavior used during development (`npm run start:resize`). |
| `WA_TUI_NO_SOUND` | Set to `1` to disable the incoming-message notification sound. |
| `WA_TUI_NO_DESKTOP_NOTIFY` | Set to `1` to disable desktop notifications for incoming messages in chats you are not currently viewing. |
| `WA_TUI_SOUND` | Optional path to an audio file (macOS: `afplay`; Linux: `paplay` / `aplay`). Overrides the default tone. |

Incoming messages play a short sound when you are **not** viewing that chat. Defaults: **macOS** — `Ping.aiff` via `afplay`; **Windows** — short two-tone console beep; **Linux** — freedesktop `complete.oga` or `message.oga`, then WAV fallback; otherwise the terminal bell. There is no sound for your own messages or for messages in the chat you currently have open.

Desktop notifications are also sent for incoming messages outside the chat you currently have open. They are best-effort: **macOS** uses `osascript`, **Linux** uses `notify-send`, and **Windows** uses a small PowerShell balloon notification.

## Scripts (development)

| Command | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `npm start` | Run the TUI |
| `npm run start:resize` | Run with `WA_TUI_RESIZE=1` |

## Maintainers: bump the Homebrew formula

After publishing a new version to npm, update **`url`**, **`sha256`**, and the version segment in the tarball path inside [`Formula/wa-tui.rb`](Formula/wa-tui.rb) to match `package.json`. Get `sha256`:

```bash
V=$(npm view @gtchakama/wa-tui version)
curl -sL "https://registry.npmjs.org/@gtchakama/wa-tui/-/wa-tui-${V}.tgz" | shasum -a 256
```

Commit the formula change on the default branch so `brew upgrade` sees it.
